# Building a Product Catalog web API using Serverless atÂ AWS
## Overview
youâ€™ll explore a real-world scenario as an experienced engineer hired to help build a scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant web API that provides data to an ecosystem of microservices. According to the specifications, the web API allows requests only from authorized sources, is responsible for delivering information about all products in the companyâ€™s catalog, and allows other services to keep the product catalog updated.

With all this information in mind, youâ€™ve decided to rely on an AWS serverless architecture based on Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB whereas the products catalog will reside on DynamoDB.
