# AWS Cloud Formation Foundational Concepts 
CloudFormation allows you to model your infrastructure in a text file. You can use JSON  or YAML  to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure.
CloudFormation automates the provisioning and updating of your infrastructure in a safe and controlled manner. There are no manual steps or controls that can lead to errors.
CloudFormation is available at no additional charge. You pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.
