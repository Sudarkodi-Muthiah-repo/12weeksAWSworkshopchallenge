# Integrating DynamoDB
The primary focus of this lab is to provide hands-on experience in retrieving data from and populating data to a DynamoDB table by using a Python script. Using DynamoDB can both enhance your understanding of DynamoDB operations and familiarize you with the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
## Tasks
* Examine the preloaded Python code to understand how it functions through the AWS Cloud9 instance that you use to edit the Python script.
* Review the LanguagesTable by using the DynamoDB console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
* Update the existing Python code so that you can insert an item into the LanguagesTable.
* Update the current Python code so that you can query the LanguagesTable by using a specific key.
* Test the Python scriptâ€™s overall functionality to update the LanguagesTable and read from it.
